# Super JSS: The Future of Angular Styling

Tired of fighting with CSS in your Angular projects? Wish you had the power of libraries like Emotion or MUI, but built for the modern Angular ecosystem? You've come to the right place.

## What is Super JSS?

Super JSS is not just another utility-class library. It's a powerful styling engine that gives you the flexibility of CSS-in-JS with the performance of atomic CSS. It's a tiny, runtime styling library that generates atomic CSS on the fly.

This means you get:

*   **Tiny Bundles:** Only the styles you actually use are included in your build.
*   **Extreme Performance:** Built on Angular Signals for lightning-fast, reactive updates.
*   **A Clean, Ergonomic API:** A joy to use, with a minimal learning curve.

## The "Sugar": Key Features

Here's what makes Super JSS so sweet:

*   **Zero-runtime footprint (almost):** We're not kidding. The styles are generated, so there's virtually no overhead.
*   **Blazing Fast:** Did we mention it's built on Signals? Your UI will be buttery smooth.
*   **Theming on the Fly:** Change your application's entire look and feel with a single line of code.
*   **Responsive by Design:** Easily create adaptive UIs with a simple and intuitive syntax.
*   **Pseudo-selectors:** `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`... we've got you covered.
*   **Pre-built Components:** A set of beautiful, themeable components to get you started.
