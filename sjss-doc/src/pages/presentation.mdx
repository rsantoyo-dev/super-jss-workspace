# Super‑JSS for Angular: Atomic CSS, Signals, and Tokens

One runtime pipeline to generate tiny, deterministic CSS with Angular Signals; responsive, token‑driven styling; and a small, typed API that stays close to CSS.

> Speaker notes: This is a working draft for the IBM Frontend internal talk. Keep content concise on slides; expand verbally using the notes. Add StackBlitz links later.

## Abstract
- Generate atomic CSS at runtime with Signals, with one merged stylesheet.
- Drive responsive and theming via tokens and ordered breakpoints (xs→xxl).
- Compose UIs with a minimal, typed API (`sj`) plus curated options and sugars.

## Audience & Goals
- Audience: Frontend engineers/designers (Carbon‑aligned), Angular‑curious.
- Goals:
  - Understand the atomic CSS pipeline and why Signals matter.
  - See responsive + tokens working together without rebuilds.
  - Learn the building blocks for incremental adoption.

## Agenda (45 + 15)
1) 0–3 Welcome + context (the pain we address)
2) 3–10 Atomic CSS via Signals (core pipeline)
3) 10–22 Deep‑dive: merge/cache/generation/injection
4) 22–30 Responsive + tokens (breakpoints, spacing, palette)
5) 30–38 Options and sugars for consistency (DX + A11y)
6) 38–43 Building blocks and adoption path
7) 43–45 Wrap‑up (3 takeaways)
8) 15 Q&A

> Speaker notes: Aim for 3 short demos (60–90s each) embedded in sections 3–5. Keep each demo to 2 steps max and show visual effect before code.

## Key Messages
- Deterministic atomic CSS with minimal friction and one stylesheet.
- Responsive + theming “token‑driven” without rebuilds.
- Small, typed API with human‑named options and useful sugars.

## 1) Atomic CSS via Signals

What happens when `[sj]` changes:
- Reactive triggers: themeVersion and current breakpoint drive re‑render points.
- Resolve + merge: inputs become a single SjStyle object (memoized).
- Generate: walk style tree, expand shorthands, handle `&:hover`/variants.
- Resolve values: numbers → spacing or rem (typography); tokens → colors.
- Inject: merge declarations per selector/media, append once to a single `<style>`.

Pipeline (mental model):
```
[sj] input(s)
  → resolve/merge (memo)
  → generate atomic rules (deterministic class ids)
  → merge by selector/media
  → append to single <style data-sjss>
```

> Speaker notes: Emphasize “one style element, merged rules, dedupe sets/maps, versioned class prefixes” as reasons DevTools stay readable and runtime churn stays low.

---

## 2) Responsive + Theme‑Driven Styling

- Breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl; min‑width media queries in theme order.
- Responsive values: any prop can accept `{ xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl }`.
- Spacing semantics: numeric spacing uses `theme.spacing(n)`; typography gets rem and unitless line‑height.
- Color tokens: `primary.main`, `blue.500` resolve from palette/colors.
- Live updates: `setTheme` / `setThemeReset` clear caches and re‑apply fast.

> Speaker notes: Show how a single numeric value becomes spacing via theme; demo switching palette or spacing function and watching classes update.

---

## 3) Options and Sugars (DX + Consistency)

- Human‑named options: `sj.padding.options.default` (compact/default/comfortable/spacious) → responsive presets without remembering numbers.
- Sugars as UX macros: `usePaint="primary"` sets background + readable text + sensible hover/focus, addressing common A11y needs.
- Why it matters: fewer manual decisions → cohesive rhythm and contrast across the system.

> Speaker notes: Contrast “padding: 16px vs 20px everywhere” with density tokens. Explain that sugars encode UX decisions so teams don’t re‑solve contrast and spacing.

---

## 4) Building Blocks for Super‑JSS

- `sj` root API: every CSS property is a typed function; `.options` provide curated values (tokens, keywords) with autocomplete.
- Shorthands: `p/px/py`, `m/mx/my`, `bg/c`, `fxDir/fxJustify/fxAItems` map to real CSS props.
- Thin components: `sj-paper`, `sj-card`, `sj-button`, `sj-flex` layer small patterns over `[sj]` while staying opt‑in.
- Deterministic ids: short semantic hashes for tiny class names.
- One stylesheet: faster parse, less churn; versioning avoids stale rules.

> Speaker notes: Reinforce that this is “CSS, but typed and ergonomic,” not a new language. Control is still granular when needed.

---

## 5) Live Demo Plan (3 micro‑demos)

1) Atomic pipeline in action (60–90s)
   - Step 1: Toggle theme spacing/palette.
   - Step 2: Show classes update with version prefix; show single `<style>` grows.
   - Fallback: Pre‑recorded GIF.

2) Responsive + tokens (60–90s)
   - Step 1: Apply `{ xs, md }` object to padding.
   - Step 2: Resize to cross breakpoints; highlight current BP.

3) Options + sugars (60–90s)
   - Step 1: Switch `sj.padding.options.default` across 2 components.
   - Step 2: Add `usePaint="primary"`; hover/focus show good contrast.

> TODO: Add StackBlitz links here for each demo.

---

## 6) Adoption Path & Interop

- Start small: add `[sj]` to one component and migrate gradually.
- Map existing tokens (e.g., Carbon palette/spacing) to theme.
- SSR/CSP: single style tag strategy; avoid unsafe inline styles.
- Performance guardrails: numbers for spacing, use `setTheme` (don’t mutate in place), bundle class option for fewer applied classes.

> Speaker notes: Focus on incremental wins. Mention that options/sugars reduce design review churn by encoding UX rules.

---

## 7) Closing & Takeaways

- Signals enable precise, fast style recomputation.
- Tokens + breakpoints deliver consistent responsive design.
- The `sj` API and sugars turn CSS‑in‑JS into an executable design system.

> Speaker notes: Leave with a clear “why now” and “how to start this week.”

---

## Q&A Anchors (15 min)

- Token mapping (e.g., Carbon) and theming strategy.
- SSR/CSP considerations and style host.
- Performance in large pages; caching and class bundling.
- Migration: hybrid approaches, risks, and rollbacks.

---

## Optional: Origin Story (Speaker Notes)

- Motivation: Angular had great component libs (Material) but mixing responsive libs + handwritten CSS led to inconsistency. Tailwind felt verbose; devs preferred JS, not remembering utility strings.
- First step: `SjStyle` as typed camelCase CSS with responsive objects.
- API evolution: `sj` root API for inline template autocomplete with `.options` (human names) so engineers don’t learn a new DSL.
- Performance pass: dedupe + one style tag + class bundling; keep data markers for debugging.
- Sugars: `usePadding/useGap/useRounded` (density), `usePaint` (contrast + states) for consistent UX.
- Signals rewrite: Angular 17+ made reactivity precise; theme changes ripple instantly.

> Speaker notes: Use a personal tone here if time permits. Keep dates off slides unless you want to pin a timeline.

## TODOs (to fill before the talk)

- Add 3 StackBlitz links (atomic pipeline, responsive + tokens, options + sugars).
- Prepare 2–3 screenshots/GIFs as demo fallbacks.
- Add a simple diagram (pipeline) as SVG or Mermaid.
- Create a short “Quick Start” slide with 3 commands or 3 code lines.
